# NextAuth.js (Auth.js) How To

This is a set of notes about how to do various things with
NextAuth.js / Auth.js in the context of a Next.js project.
These notes were originally written in a paper notebook as
personal reminders, but I have decided to publish them in
the form of comments and README files in a free open-source
project.

This project is intended to match with Auth.js 5.0,
Next.js 15.0, React 19.0, and later versions. I have
attempted to bring everything up to date but I have
probably missed some things.

A key goal of this project is to document why things are
the way they are to aid in understanding existing code.
The Auth.js documentation is relatively good if you know
what you are trying to achieve. It is not so useful if
you are trying to work out what some existing code does.
